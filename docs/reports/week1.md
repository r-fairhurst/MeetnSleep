# Week 1 Report

## Team Report:
#### Goals from last week:
N/A
#### Current Contributions: 
This week, we developed our idea, discussed our plans for the project, and completed the setup assignments like our Proposal. We’ve navigated two issues so far: understanding the project’s requirements through Canvas and making clear our product’s specific major features and extra features to focus on.
#### - **Future Plans:** 
Finish the “Project Elicitation” and, once done, work on the project presentation. Which shouldn’t take more than 3 hours and should be completed by 1/21/25

## Individual Contributions:
#### William Morton:
- **Current Contributions:**  Worked on the project proposal, Weekly report, and Project Elicitation. Contributed towards planning the group presentation. There were some difficulties, especially with navigating the canvas page and helping my team determine what needs to be done.
- **Future Plans:** Collaborate with group members to work on the project presentation and also help finish the Project Elicitation group assignment. Complete personal contribution for the project elicitation by 1/19. Complete presentation slides with team by 1/19.

#### Ryan Fairhurst
- **Current Contributions:** Worked on and contributed to the project proposal. I created the project Github and added the team members as contributors and the staff. I added the main GitHub format for reports and the week 1 report. I also created a Discord server to help them manage/communicate with each other. I got stuck on figuring out what the assignment wanted by giving “editor” permissions to the staff, as it was not clear, invited them as contributors
- **Future Plans:** Help work on the project presentation slides and also the “Project Elicitation.” Which shouldn’t take more than 3 hours and should be completed by 1/19/25

#### Aiden Reedy
- **Current Contributions:**  Worked on the project proposal and the weekly report. Helped come up with ideas for the goals of the project. 
- **Future Plans:** Work on the presentation slides and elicitation.

#### Aidan Daly
- **Current Contributions:**  Worked on project proposal, added my weekly report, engaged in discussions in Discord. What worked for me this week was the communication between the team. What didn’t work as well for me this week was figuring out a time that worked with me and the group to have a video for our assignments as I had to miss the meeting due to time conflicts. I thankfully was not stuck at any point during this week. What I learned this week was that you can use Python to create a text to speech(TTS) application.  
- **Future Plans:** Work on the project presentation slides and the “ Project elicitation” by adding by use case and contributing on the rest of the document. Planning to get this done by Saturday 1/18/25.

#### Ian McKee
- **Current Contributions:**  Worked on high-level abstract of project proposal. Helped declare team communication platforms with Ryan. As team leader gave announcements to group making clear our meetings.
- **Future Plans:** Within the next week, plan to help develop the high-level explanations of our project on our Presentation. I plan to further assess the team’s specific roles as team leader and see where each of us can contribute our strengths.

#### Arianna Valencia:
- **Current Contributions:**  I worked on the Project Proposal during the group meeting. What worked for me this week is how effectively the team collaborated by creating polls/votes for group decisions and determining meeting times. I think the main area I had trouble in was adapting to meetings being primarily online. 
- **Future Plans:** Work on the Project Presentation slides and Project Elicitation. 

#### Nadir Isweesi:
- **Current Contributions:** Worked with the team on the project proposal, and helped them choose what project are we working on.
- **Future Plans:** Work on the project presentation with the team and create at least one of the slides. Also, I will work on the project elicitation.
