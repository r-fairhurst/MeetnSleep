# Week 2 Report

## Team Report:
- **Goals from last week:**  Our goals from last week were to ultimately complete the Project Elicitation assignment and the project presentation by Tuesday. We also planned on discussing concerns that we had the APIs sufficient for the project.
- **Current Contributions:** We’ve now confirmed the relevant and sufficient audio and LLM APIs online exist. We learned this week to make our roles more specific to our particular strengths and involved to different aspects of the software engineering life cycle.
- **Future Plans:** As per our timeline and roles, carry out our specific tasks, collaborating as needed for designers, backend engineers, etc. We have to think about GUI development, APIs on the backend, among other specifics as we start to implement this work. By the end of the week, 1/26.

## Individual Contributions:
#### William Morton:
- **Last Week Contributions:** Helped finish the project proposal, Weekly report 1.
- **Current Contributions:** Worked on the project elicitation, and the project presentation. 
- **Future Plans:** Collaborate with the other backend engineer to develop a prototype for the backend audio processing component. 
This needs to be completed by 1/26.

#### Ryan Fairhurst
- **Last Week Contributions:**  Helped finish the first weekly report and project proposal. Along with creating the GitHub and adding the necessary .md files, including the weekly report and Creating the Trello page.
- **Current Contributations** Helped to create the project elicitation, the presentation on 1/22, and this week's weekly report. The main struggles I had was figuring out when to meet and how to understand/interpret the instructions for both of these as they were pretty vague at times.
- **Future Planes:** I will help decide on the desktop GUI framework and collaborate with backend engineers to develop a prototype for the audio processing component. By the end of the week (1/26)

#### Aidan Daly
- **Last Week Contributions:**  Worked on project proposal, added my weekly report, engaged in discussions in Discord. What worked for me this week was the communication between the team. What didn’t work as well for me this week was figuring out a time that worked with me and the group to have a video for our assignments as I had to miss the meeting due to time conflicts. I thankfully was not stuck at any point during this week. What I learned this week was that you can use Python to create a text to speech(TTS) application. 
- **Current Contributations** Helped team with the project elicitation, so that we could finish updating the project proposal. Also helped the team with the presentation slide deck. Finally, turned in the zipped folder of the slide deck and project proposal to canvas. 
- **Future Planes:** Collaborate with the front and back end engineers to make sure there are no bugs in our current implementation. 

#### Ian McKee
- **Last Week Contributions:**  Within the next week, planned to help develop the high-level explanations of our project on our Presentation. I plan to further assess the team’s specific roles as team leader and see where each of us can contribute our strengths.
- **Current Contributations** Leading up to today I organized team meetings and opened up concerns brought up last meeting that our online tools we’d need to create the project were sufficient. Led the team presentation, proofread and adapted the presentation materials, the proposal and this document. I had trouble convening with the rest of the group after last meeting, as only 2 of us were there.
- **Future Planes:** I will discuss with members Ryan and Arianna on the GUI and UX organization of our tool, by the end of the week, 1/26. 
I plan to also discuss with the backend engineers and the rest of the group, making sure we’re on the same page of requirements and feasibility. Also by the end of this week, 1/26.

#### Arianna Valencia 
- **Last Week Contributions:**  Worked with the team to create the proposal and did my part of the weekly report. 
- **Current Contributations** Worked on project elicitation during the team meeting. Helped brainstorm for how to break down use cases and make them more specific on our elicitation. Did my part of the weekly report.
- **Future Planes:** Do research on different frameworks for creating a GUI that are compatible with python and start planning out and designing the layout of our application. 

#### Aiden Reedy
- **Last Week Contributions:**  I met with the team to work on and finalize the project proposal and did my weekly report.
- **Current Contributations**  Worked on the project elicitation by creating a use case. I presented our slides to the class and did my weekly report.
- **Future Planes:** Collaborate with the other backend engineer to develop a prototype for the backend audio processing component which will be done before the 26th.

#### Nadir Isweesi
- **Last Week Contributions:** I worked on the project proposal.
- **Current Contributations**  Worked on the project presentation with the team and helped them with the slides. Also, I worked on the project elicitation.
- **Future Planes:** I will work with the backend team to generate transcription when audio is playing.
