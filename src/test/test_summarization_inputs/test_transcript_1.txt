Participants: Alex (Project Manager), Jordan (Developer), Sam (Designer)

Alex: Good morning, everyone. Let’s start with project updates. Jordan, how’s the API integration going?

Jordan: Morning! The API integration is about 80% complete. I ran into some authentication issues, but I expect to resolve them by tomorrow.

Alex: Great. Sam, how’s the UI design coming along?

Sam: The main screens are complete. I’m finalizing the responsive design today. Should we review the color scheme again?

Alex: Let’s schedule a quick review tomorrow. Anything blocking your progress?

Sam: Nope, all good.

Alex: Awesome. Jordan, if you need any support with the API, let me know. Let’s aim for the sprint demo on Friday.

Jordan & Sam: Sounds good!
