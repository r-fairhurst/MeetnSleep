Participants: Jamie (Scrum Master), Chris (Developer), Pat (QA Engineer), Riley (Product Owner)

Jamie: Let’s kick off the sprint retrospective. What went well this sprint?

Chris: The daily stand-ups kept us on track. Also, the pair programming sessions helped speed up debugging.

Pat: Testing was smoother because of clearer acceptance criteria this time.

Jamie: Awesome. What didn’t go so well?

Riley: We underestimated the time needed for the new feature stories.

Chris: Agreed. The dependencies weren’t clear upfront.

Jamie: Noted. Let’s improve backlog grooming for better estimations. Any action items?

Pat: Maybe a dedicated session for dependency mapping next sprint?

Riley: Sounds good to me.

Jamie: Great suggestions. Let’s keep improving. Thanks, team!
