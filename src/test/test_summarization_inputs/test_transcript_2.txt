Participants: Taylor (Marketing Lead), Casey (Content Creator), Morgan (Data Analyst)

Taylor: Thanks for joining, team. We’re here to brainstorm ideas for the spring campaign. Casey, got any creative themes?

Casey: I was thinking of a “Fresh Start” theme—emphasizing new beginnings, maybe tied to user success stories.

Morgan: That’s interesting. Data shows our audience engages more with personal narratives. This could boost retention.

Taylor: Love it. What about formats? Videos, blogs, webinars?

Casey: Short-form videos would perform well. Also, interactive polls on social media.

Taylor: Good call. Morgan, can you pull engagement data from last spring for comparison?

Morgan: Sure, I’ll have that ready by tomorrow.

Taylor: Perfect. Let’s reconvene next week with drafts and data insights.
