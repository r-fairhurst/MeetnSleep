- **Last Week Contributions:** This week I intend to work with my team to bolster our project architecture and design based off of our critical reviews from our presentation on monday. We will make sure that we finalize which frameworks we want to use for the front and back end of the assignment, including which LLM to use for our meeting summarizer. I partook in the presentation on monday by highlighting how our app minute-meet solves the problems that we want to solve. I also joined my team in our standup meetings after each class and our zoom meeting over the weekend so that we could all stay on track and have great communication. 
- **Current Contributions:** I will be working with the team this week to finish up our implementation prototype. When we have finished our prototype, I will work on testing it. I will make there that I can spot any bugs in the app, and if there is I will report it to the frontend and backend teams. I will also work with these teams to help fix the bugs that I spot. I have also attended all our stand up meetings after class and have been very active on our discord chat. 
- **Future Plans:** I plan to continue communicating with the rest of the team about our prototype until we have release our final product. Whilst testing the prototype or final implementation I will also recommend any changes that I think we should have on our front end for nice UI design or the backend for our summarization tool. I will also help set up our github action tool on github so that we can have automation in our release cycles. Finally, I plan to contribute with the team in our final project as a presenter.

- **Current Contributions:** I have started the implementation of opening up a summary file or transcription and displaying it as HTML. I have pushed what I have accomplished so far, but requires further testing and to see if this is how we want to handle loading txt files for displayment.
- **Future Plans:** I plan on communicating with the rest of our team about the front and back end of our prototype, along with the creation of documentation for developers and users to help with their site. Along with setting up GitHub Actions to set up automatic testing for our project to catch any input errors and the like for us. I also plan on finishing the

#### Aiden Reedy
- **Last Week Contributions:**  I used threading to lower the gap in recordings when making api calls and also worked on output of the transcript. I met with the team and helped make our midterm slide show then later presented it to the class. I also added my weekly report.
- **Current Contributions:** Working on finding a way to lower the gap in recordings when making api calls, testing having 2 recording threads that overlap and alternate so there's no gap.
- **Future Plans:**  Connect the speech to text, transcription and summarizer all together / to the front end and get a prototype going.
