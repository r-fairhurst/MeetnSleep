# Week 6 Report

## Team Report:
- **Goals From Last Week:** Develop preliminary documentation for how the user'll use the service, and how their data is handled (APIs in the background, etc.). Committing a working webpage on ENGR server using base HTML, CSS, simple Django by 2/18. Integrate our successful back-end handling of input functionality, and successful summarizing to front-end users will interact with.
- **Current Contributions:** We further developed our front-end and back-end.
- **Future Plans:** We will be working towards our beta release which means we will be integrating our frontend and backend systems for the first time and handling any errors that may arise.

## Individual Contributions:
#### William Morton
- **Last Week Contributions:** I was focused on completing the implementation of the backend systems for our project. I will be worked on finalizing the summary systems and connecting it with the other backend system.
- **Current Contributions:** This week the backend team is focused on adding tests to verify that the backend system is working as intended. We will also be working on creating documentation for both users and other developers so that they can have a full understanding of our system. 
- **Future Plans:** Future plans for the backend team include finalizing the implementation of the backend so that it can be used with the frontend to provide both transcription and summarization. 

#### Aidan Daly
- **Last Week Contributions:** This week I intend to work with my team to bolster our project architecture and design based off of our critical reviews from our presentation on monday. We will make sure that we finalize which frameworks we want to use for the front and back end of the assignment, including which LLM to use for our meeting summarizer. I partook in the presentation on monday by highlighting how our app minute-meet solves the problems that we want to solve. I also joined my team in our standup meetings after each class and our zoom meeting over the weekend so that we could all stay on track and have great communication. 
- **Current Contributions:** I will be working with the team this week to finish up our implementation prototype. When we have finished our prototype, I will work on testing it. I will make there that I can spot any bugs in the app, and if there is I will report it to the frontend and backend teams. I will also work with these teams to help fix the bugs that I spot. I have also attended all our stand up meetings after class and have been very active on our discord chat. 
- **Future Plans:** I plan to continue communicating with the rest of the team about our prototype until we have release our final product. Whilst testing the prototype or final implementation I will also recommend any changes that I think we should have on our front end for nice UI design or the backend for our summarization tool. I will also help set up our github action tool on github so that we can have automation in our release cycles. Finally, I plan to contribute with the team in our final project as a presenter. 

#### Ryan Fairhurst
- **Last Week Contributions:** Submitted final version of our projects midterm/presentation. Added week5 report to github. Finalized our milestones/project risks/frontend design and architecture. Helped finish our project presentation
- **Current Contributions:** I have started the implementation of opening up a summary file or transcription and displaying it as HTML. I have pushed what I have accomplished so far, but requires further testing and to see if this is how we want to handle loading txt files for displayment.
- **Future Plans:** I plan on communicating with the rest of our team about the front and back end of our prototype, along with the creation of documentation for developers and users to help with their site. Along with setting up GitHub Actions to set up automatic testing for our project to catch any input errors and the like for us. I also plan on finishing the 

#### Ian McKee
- **Last Week Contributions:** I plan to find time this week to commit a workable HTML and CSS front-end, on some accessible website, like the ENGR servers. Up through 2/11 the webpage hosting can be trivial, with base HTML and CSS, and Arianna and my development of the back-end on Django framework.
- **Current Contributions:** I had some HTML and CSS development of the front-end, and discussed with Arianna some GUI design choices.
- **Future Plans:** I will work further with Arianna on the Django implementation, and talk with our back-end team on connecting the database with this.

#### Aiden Reedy
- **Last Week Contributions:**  I used threading to lower the gap in recordings when making api calls and also worked on output of the transcript. I met with the team and helped make our midterm slide show then later presented it to the class. I also added my weekly report.
- **Current Contributions:** Working on finding a way to lower the gap in recordings when making api calls, testing having 2 recording threads that overlap and alternate so there's no gap.
- **Future Plans:**  Connect the speech to text, transcription and summarizer all together / to the front end and get a prototype going.

#### Nadir Isweesi
- **Last Week Contributions:** Added text summarization to meetings using LLMs!
- **Current Contributions:**  improving text summarization more to make it summarize text in the best way we can.
- **Future Plans:** Save the summarization to a separate file after the meeting.
