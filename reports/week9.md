- **Last Week Contributions:**I worked with the backend and frontend team to test our functionality of the current application and make sure that the frontend and backend are connected properly, and all of our use cases are working. 
- **Current Contributions:** I created the summarize transcript implementation for our assignment by calling the gemini summarizing api. Along with this I worked with ryan to allow users to download these summary .txt files to their local machine from our application. 
- **Future Plans:** I plan to take our beta testing critiques and try to fix those issues before we submit our initial release of our project to the public. I also plan to work with the group on our poster slides, as well as our demo and the living document.
