#### Aidan Daly
- **Last Week Contributions:**I created the summarize transcript implementation for our assignment by calling the gemini summarizing api. Along with this I worked with ryan to allow users to download these summary .txt files to their local machine from our application. 
- **Current Contributions:** I worked with the team to transfer all that we did for this assignment to a poster for us to show off to our "stockholders" on wednesday 3/10. I worked with my group to finish our deliverables, including our living document and our demo video for our project. 
- **Future Plans:** I plan to release our first full release with the rest of my group by the end of this term. After that and the term is over, i plan to continue working on the repo to make our application even better, as well with working with others who want to contribute to our open source application.
