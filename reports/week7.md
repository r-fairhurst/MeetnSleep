# Week 7 Report

## Team Report:
- **Goals From Last Week:** 
- **Current Contributions:** Completed CI integration with GitHub Actions, implemented automatic testing of our python files using pytest and the GitHub actions.
- **Future Plans:** We plan to integrate the frontend and backend, with team discussions, by end of week 2/30. We plan to have draft documentation of at least the backend by end of week 2/28.

## Individual Contributions:
#### William Morton
- **Last Week Contributions:** Added tests to verify that the backend system is working as intended. Also worked on creating documentation for both users and other developers so that they can have a full understanding of our system.
- **Current Contributions:** Current plans for the backend team include finalizing the implementation of the backend so that it can be used with the frontend to provide both transcription and summarization. This is in preparation for our beta release.
- **Future Plans:** Myself and the rest of the backend team will be working on polishing our system and integrating it with our frontend.

#### Aidan Daly
- **Last Week Contributions:** I will be working with the team this week to finish up our implementation prototype. When we have finished our prototype, I will work on testing it. I will make there that I can spot any bugs in the app, and if there is I will report it to the frontend and backend teams. I will also work with these teams to help fix the bugs that I spot. I have also attended all our stand up meetings after class and have been very active on our discord chat. 
- **Current Contributions:** I will be participating in all of our team stand up meetings in class. I will work with the team to create tests for our prototype. With these tests we will go ahead and debug our codebase, while pushing the changes to the repo. 
- **Future Plans:**  I plan to help with the front end development. I also plan to create my validation, integration, unit and system tests and add them to the repo by 2/25.

#### Ryan Fairhurst
- **Last Week Contributions:** I started the implementation of opening up a summary file or transcription and displaying it as HTML. I have pushed what I have accomplished so far, but requires further testing and to see if this is how we want to handle loading txt files for displayment.
- **Current Contributions:** Setting up our CI integration with GitHub Actions, helping decide on testing software we will use for your project, as well as comparing different CI's before utimetly deciding to use Github actions. I implemented the automatic testing of our python files using pytest and the GitHub actions.
- **Future Plans:** Add a unit for one of our main functions/programs. This will be done by 2/25 at night. As well as helping with frontend development

#### Ian McKee
- **Last Week Contributions:** I will work further with Arianna on the Django implementation, and talk with our back-end team on connecting the database with this.
- **Current Contributions:** Revisited the Django setup to better understand how it connects to frontend. 
- **Future Plans:** Clarify dependencies with team on backend side, to facilitate backend integration, this will be done by middle of week 2/26. I'll implement one test. Help backend team with writing documentation, and even facilitate drafts for frontend documentation, by end of week 2/30.
