# Week 3 Report

## Team Report:
**Goals From Last Week:** As per our timeline and roles, carry out our specific tasks, collaborating as needed for designers, backend engineers, etc. We have to think about GUI development, APIs on the backend, among other specifics as we start to implement this work. By the end of the week, 1/26.
**Current Contributions:** 
- Created the basic structure of the backend hosting service.
- Implemented the initial speech-to-text script
- Divided tasks among ourselves
**Future Plans:** 
- Create the initial web interface using Flask (before next Tuesday 2/4)
- Get transcripts of existing meeting videos/audios
- Finalize GUI framework decision and develop a prototype for GUI
## Individual Contributions:
#### William Morton
- **Last Week Contributions:** Finished project elicitation and presented project idea to stakeholders (Instructor and Classmates)
- **Current Contributions:** Collaborate with the other backend engineer to develop a prototype for the backend audio processing component and begin to plan/develop basic features.
- **Future Plans:** Complete relevant backend audio processing architecture for the app (Transcribing videos/audio). Present findings and ideas to team leader and team members.
Finish work by 2/2
#### Aidan Daly
- **Last Week Contributions:** Helped team with the project elicitation, so that we could finish updating the project proposal. Also helped the team with the presentation slide deck. Finally, turned in the zipped folder of the slide deck and project proposal to canvas. 
- **Current Contributions:** Contributing on the Trello board to help decide what frameworks we will be using for the project. Helped decide on which GUI design framework to use( possibly Figma). Helped decide on which speech to text Python library to use for the application. Finally, helped the group figure out how to summarize the text we got from the speech to text implementation. 
- **Future Plans:** Once we have decided on a GUI framework to use and have started making our initial prototypes. I will begin to quality check what we have so far. I will start the testing process of our prototype and if I find any bugs, report them to the development team. After reporting the bugs, I will collaborate with the team to fix these bugs. 
#### Ryan Fairhurst
**Last Week Contributions:** Helped to create the project elicitation, the presentation on 1/22, and this week's weekly report. Attended last weeks TA meeting
**Current Contributions:** Added the weekly tasks we need to decide on to Trello, along with some of the other things we need to work on/have finished. Helped figure out what GUI framework we might use
**Future Plans:** Help create any GUI design prototypes using figma to translate to the GUI framework later, And help making initial prototypes for speech to text, summarization, and the desktop app
#### Ian McKee
- **Last Week Contributions:** I will discuss with members Ryan and Arianna on the GUI and UX organization of our tool, by the end of the week, 1/26. 
- I plan to also discuss with the backend engineers and the rest of the group, making sure weâ€™re on the same page of requirements and feasibility. Also by the end of this week, 1/26.
- **Current Contributions:** I discussed with Nadir the feasibility of running our app. We decided a Flask web implementation would be simplest. I discussed with the UX team about our GUI and framework for it.
**Future Plans:** 
- I plan to work further on GUI design, completing a prototype with Arianna and Ryan. By 2/4.
- I plan to begin/develop the base of the Flask framework for our web portion hosting our service by 2/4.
#### Aiden Reedy
- **Last Week Contributions:** Worked on the project elicitation by creating a use case. I presented our slides to the class and did my weekly report.
- **Current Contributions:** I completed my part of the weekly report, and talked with the other backend engineer to figure out our plan for implementing the speech recognition/speech-to-text. Discussed how we plan to implement the application as a whole.
- **Future Plans:** Start to implement the speech-to-text and figure out how to best handle the file storing as a whole. Divide tasks for the speech-to-text implementation with other backend engineers.
#### Arianna Valencia
- **Last Week Contributions:**  Worked on project elicitation during the team meeting. Helped brainstorm for how to condense use cases, as well as created a use case. Also did my part of the weekly report.
- **Current Contributions:** Did research on a variety of different frameworks available for creating a GUI based around python. Interacted on the trello board about these frameworks 
- **Future Plans:** Collaborated with Ian to figure out the planning for the GUI and plan to create a prototype by 02/04
#### Nadir Isweesi
- **Last Week Contributions:** Helped the team creating the project elicitation, the presentation.
- **Current Contributions:** I designed the project structure for the app, created a real-time speech-to-text small app, as well as implementing a video-to-audio script to use the audio later and get its transcript and summarize it.
- **Future Plans:** Will implement the backend side with William Morton to get the transcript of existing videos/audios.
