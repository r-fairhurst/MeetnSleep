# Week 5 Report

## Team Report:
- **Goals From Last Week:** - We need to develop preliminary documentation for how the user'll use the service, and how their data is handled (APIs in the background, etc.).
- We plan on finalizing our front-end framework and committing a working webpage on ENGR server by 2/11.
- We plan on getting the basics of test handling.

- **Current Contributions:** Finalized project architecture. We added microphone input functionality to our working code. We decided on Django, abandoning Flask, to handle our HTML and CSS on the front-end. We presented our mid-term project update to the class. We organized our team collaboration on Trello in line with requirements. 
- **Future Plans:** - Develop preliminary documentation for how the user'll use the service, and how their data is handled (APIs in the background, etc.).
- Committing a working webpage on ENGR server using base HTML, CSS, simple Django by 2/18.
- Integrate our successful back-end handling of input functionality, and successful summarizing to front-end users will interact with.

## Individual Contributions:
#### William Morton
- **Last Week Contributions:** Worked on the summarization tool and determining which technologies we will be using to accomplish it. Created tests for summarization using the OpenAI API, Gemini API, BART, T5, and Sumy libraries.
- **Current Contributions:** As a backend engineer, I will be focused on completing the implementation of the backend systems for our project. This week it is looking like I will be working on finalizing the summary systems and connecting it with the other backend system.
- **Future Plans:** In our next steps we will be working to verify that both backend systems work as expected via tests. We are also working towards combining both backend systems so that they can be exposed to the frontend in a modular way. The overall goal for this week is to have a concrete example of passing an audio file into the backend for transcription and summarization.

#### Aidan Daly
- **Last Week Contributions:** This week I worked with the team on the project architecture and design assignment that was due this tuesday. I have also collaborated with the group to figure out what front end framework we want to use and how it will help us integrate the front and back end. I have also attended every stand up meeting after class to communicate these things with the team. This week I will also work with the team to create our slides for our 10 minute presentation due sunday. 
- **Current Contributions:** This week I intend to work with my team to bolster our project architecture and design based off of our critical reviews from our presentation on monday. We will make sure that we finalize which frameworks we want to use for the front and back end of the assignment, including which LLM to use for our meeting summarizer. I partook in the presentation on monday by highlighting how our app minute-meet solves the problems that we want to solve. I also joined my team in our standup meetings after each class and our zoom meeting over the weekend so that we could all stay on track and have great communication. 
- **Future Plans:** In the future, I plan to start developing the front end ui with the ui team. There has not been much work for me to do as a tester, so i changed my role to software tester/front end. So after I finish with the front end team on designing the UI, I will begin to start testing our prototypes, making sure our results are as expected. I will make sure that we also have no bugs in our code. However, if there is bugs, I will report them to the rest of the team and work with them on fixing them. 

#### Ryan Fairhurst
- **Last Week Contributions:**  Finalized our project architecture, and helping with further fleshing out our project milestones, project documentation, project risks, and software design. 
- **Current Contributions:** Submitted final version of our projects midterm/presentation. Added week5 report to github. Finalized our milestones/project risks/frontend design and architecture. Helped finish our project presentation 
- **Future Plans:** code our archive capabilites by 2/17/25, which includes viewing old summaries and transcripts

#### Ian McKee
- **Last Week Contributions:** The following week, I plan to commit a workable HTML and CSS front-end, on some accessible website, like the ENGR servers. Arianna and I are both handling the front-end here. Up through 2/11 this part of the webpage hosting should be simple. I will help develop the base of the Flask framework for our web portion with the front-end and back-end teams, hosting our service by 2/11.
- **Current Contributions:** Helped refine our project's UI architecture and reduced the problem with current services down to the specifics during mid-term presentation this week. We scrapped Flask and are using Django.
- **Future Plans:** I plan to find time this week to commit a workable HTML and CSS front-end, on some accessible website, like the ENGR servers. Up through 2/11 the webpage hosting can be trivial, with base HTML and CSS, and Arianna and my development of the back-end on Django framework.
