## Individual Contributions:
#### William Morton
- **Last Week Contributions:** Complete relevant backend audio processing architecture for the app (Transcribing videos/audio). Present findings and ideas to team leader and team members.

- **Future Plans:** 

#### Aidan Daly
- **Last Week Contributions:** Contributing on the Trello board to help decide what frameworks we will be using for the project. Helped decide on which GUI design framework to use( possibly Figma). Helped decide on which speech to text Python library to use for the application. Finally, helped the group figure out how to summarize the text we got from the speech to text implementation. 
- **Current Contributions:** This week I worked with the team on the project architecture and design assignment that was due this tuesday. I have also collaborated with the group to figure out what front end framework we want to use and how it will help us integrate the front and back end. I have also attended every stand up meeting after class to communicate these things with the team. This week I will also work with the team to create our slides for our 10 minute presentation due sunday. 
- **Future Plans:** As the tester I will start to test and debug our prototype for the frontend and the backend as we start to implement them. Since this is not too much work, I will also work as a wildcard to help the frontend and backend when needed. This could be for when I spot a bug, I can help whichever group add changes to their code to make it more robust and free from bugs. 

#### Ryan Fairhurst
- **Last Week Contributions:** Decided on GUI frameworks completing a prototype with Arianna and Ian.
- **Current Contributions:** Finalized our project architecture, and helping with further fleshing out our project milestones, project documentation, project risks, and software design. 
- **Future Plans:** Using our project architecture/design/plan I will be helping with the GUI. I plan to help begin/develop the base of the Flask framework for our web portion hosting our service by 2/4. 

#### Ian McKee
- **Last Week Contributions:** - I plan to work further on GUI design, completing a prototype with Arianna and Ryan. By 2/4.

#### Aiden Reedy
- **Last Week Contributions:**  I completed my part of the weekly report, and talked with the other backend engineer to figure out our plan for implementing the speech recognition/speech-to-text. Discussed how we plan to implement the application as a whole.
- **Current Contributions:**  Added microphone input to the speech-to-text and tested it. Did two of the risks and the backend's part of part 2 for the Project Architecture and Design assignment. Preformed some tests on the summarizer and did research into other options for the summarizer. Did my part of the weekly report.
- **Future Plans:**  Add threading to the speech-to-text so there's no pause while it sends the recording to the API. Add an output to file feature to the speech-to-text.
