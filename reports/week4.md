# Week 4 Report

## Team Report:
- **Goals From Last Week:**     - Create the initial web interface using Flask (before next Tuesday 2/4)
    - Get transcripts of existing meeting videos/audios
    - Finalize GUI framework decision and develop a prototype for GUI
- **Current Contributions:** We added microphone input functionality to our working code. We organized our team collaboration on Trello in line with requirements. We are completing our decision on our front-end framework. Within HTML and CSS, we'll handle either Django or Flask. 

- **Future Plans:** - We need to develop preliminary documentation for how the user'll use the service, and how their data is handled (APIs in the background, etc.).
    - We plan on finalizing our front-end framework and committing a working webpage on ENGR server by 2/11.
    - We plan on getting the basics of test handling.

## Individual Contributions:
#### William Morton
- **Last Week Contributions:** Complete relevant backend audio processing architecture for the app (Transcribing videos/audio). Present findings and ideas to team leader and team members.
Also contributed to developing a summarization solution for our meeting summarization component. 
- **Current Contributions:** Currently working on finalizing the summarization tool and determining which technologies we will be using to accomplish it. Current possible solutions include using the OpenAI API, BART, T5, Sumy.
- **Future Plans:** As a backend engineer, I will be focused on completing the implementation of the backend systems for our project. In our next steps we will be working to verify that both backend systems work as expected via tests.
We are also working towards combining both backend systems so that they can be exposed to the frontend in a modular way. 

#### Aidan Daly
- **Last Week Contributions:** Contributing on the Trello board to help decide what frameworks we will be using for the project. Helped decide on which GUI design framework to use( possibly Figma). Helped decide on which speech to text Python library to use for the application. Finally, helped the group figure out how to summarize the text we got from the speech to text implementation. 
- **Current Contributions:** This week I worked with the team on the project architecture and design assignment that was due this tuesday. I have also collaborated with the group to figure out what front end framework we want to use and how it will help us integrate the front and back end. I have also attended every stand up meeting after class to communicate these things with the team. This week I will also work with the team to create our slides for our 10 minute presentation due sunday. 
- **Future Plans:** As the tester I will start to test and debug our prototype for the frontend and the backend as we start to implement them. Since this is not too much work, I will also work as a wildcard to help the frontend and backend when needed. This could be for when I spot a bug, I can help whichever group add changes to their code to make it more robust and free from bugs. 

#### Ryan Fairhurst
- **Last Week Contributions:** Decided on GUI frameworks completing a prototype with Arianna and Ian.
- **Current Contributions:** Finalized our project architecture, and helping with further fleshing out our project milestones, project documentation, project risks, and software design. 
- **Future Plans:** Using our project architecture/design/plan I will be helping with the GUI. I plan to help begin/develop the base of the Flask framework for our web portion hosting our service by 2/4. 

#### Ian McKee
- **Last Week Contributions:** - I plan to work further on GUI design, completing a prototype with Arianna and Ryan. By 2/4.
    - I plan to begin/develop the base of the Flask framework for our web portion hosting our service by 2/4.
- **Current Contributions:** I worked with Arianna to flesh out the front-end, the beginning GUI designs and front-end framework. We worked through Django and Flask. I got stuck on Django implementation with the HTML and CSS side. What worked is our GUI draft designs on Canva, to prepare how we want the user to interact with our application.
- **Future Plans:** - The following week, I plan to commit a workable HTML and CSS front-end, on some accessible website, like the ENGR servers. Arianna and I are both handling the front-end here. Up through 2/11 this part of the webpage hosting should be simple.
- I will help develop the base of the Flask framework for our web portion with the front-end and back-end teams, hosting our service by 2/11.

#### Aiden Reedy
- **Last Week Contributions:**  I completed my part of the weekly report, and talked with the other backend engineer to figure out our plan for implementing the speech recognition/speech-to-text. Discussed how we plan to implement the application as a whole.
- **Current Contributions:**  Added microphone input to the speech-to-text and tested it. Did two of the risks and the backend's part of part 2 for the Project Architecture and Design assignment. Preformed some tests on the summarizer and did research into other options for the summarizer. Did my part of the weekly report.
- **Future Plans:**  Add threading to the speech-to-text so there's no pause while it sends the recording to the API. Add an output to file feature to the speech-to-text.

#### Arianna Valencia
- **Last Week Contributions:** Collaborated with Ian to figure out the planning for the GUI and plan to create a prototype by 02/04

#### Nadir Isweesi
- **Last Week Contributions:** Will implement the backend side with William Morton to get the transcript of existing videos/audios.
